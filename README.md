# TextCoverageProblem

## Abstract
The Set Cover Problem is a research issue in computer science with a lot of applications e.g.
in machine learning, data mining and information retrieval. It is about selecting as few sets as
possible from a collection that cover some universe. The aim of this project is to compare two
approaches - a deterministic one and a statistical - and to rate them by concerns of coverage
rate and computation time.
